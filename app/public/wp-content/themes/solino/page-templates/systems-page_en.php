			Solar energy systems are technological systems that convert sunlight into electricity. These systems typically include solar panels, inverters and battery storage. Solar panels capture light from the sun through photovoltaic cells and convert it into electrical energy. This electricity is then converted by inverters from direct current to alternating current, making it available for use in houses or businesses. At the same time, the solar energy system is often combined with battery storage units to provide electrical energy even when there is no sunlight. As a result, solar energy systems provide a clean, renewable and sustainable source of electricity, meeting energy needs while protecting the environment.
